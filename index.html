        <p>The Luminaries is a miniseries television event based on the 2013 novel (of the same name) by Eleanor Catton. Using the live-fast/die-hard gold rush of 1866 as a backdrop, the series spins a tale of love and betrayal, weaving in a touch of astrology and magic for intrigue.</p>
        <p>Though not explicitly stated in the television series, every character in the novel is ties to an astrological sign or celestial body in the solar system. Journalist Justine Jordan elaborates: 
            <article>&quot;...characters are not only associated with signs of the zodiac, or the sun and moon (the "luminaries" of the title), but interact with each other according to the predetermined movement of the heavens, while each of the novel's 12 parts decreases in length over the course of the book to mimic the moon waning through its lunar cycle.&quot;</article>
