        <div id="special">Published in 2013, the novel by Eleanor Catton won the Man Booker Prize that year. With that, at 28 years old, Catton became the youngest author ever to win the award.            
            <br>
            After a childhood visit to Hokitika, Catton was enthralled by the place. Before writing the book, she returned to get to know the ins and outs of Hokitika intimately so she could do the location and its inhabitants justice. The book is organized and written with specific goals in mind. Though not explicitly stated in the television series, every character in the novel is ties to an astrological sign or celestial body in the solar system. Journalist Justine Jordan elaborates: </br>
            <article>&quot;...characters are not only associated with signs of the zodiac, or the sun and moon (the "luminaries" of the title), but interact with each other according to the predetermined movement of the heavens, while each of the novel's 12 parts decreases in length over the course of the book to mimic the moon waning through its lunar cycle.&quot;</article>
