            <p>The Luminaries is a miniseries television event based on the 2013 novel (of the same name) by Eleanor Catton. Using the live-fast/die-hard gold rush of 1866 as a backdrop, the series spins a tale of love and betrayal, weaving in a touch of astrology and magic for intrigue.</p>
            <p>Twelve men from diverse backgrounds are struck together by circumstance and have to come to a decision about what to do with a great treasure and a prostitute accused of murder. The series explores not only the harsh life of the late 19th century, but also the differences between men's and women's roles, as well as how one's origins influence other people's perceptions and attitudes. </p>
